Xiaoliang Yu (於曉亮) joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as an Assistant Professor (Research) in July 2020. He leads the YU’s Smart Battery Lab, which currently has 4 Postdoctoral Fellows, and 5 PhD students. The lab has been sponsored by various funding bodies since its establishment in 2020. It was also funded with three PhD quotas by the highly-competitive PolyU Presidential PhD Fellowship Scheme (PPPFS) in 2022/23 and 2023/24 admissions. Our sponsors include Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (香港研究資助局), Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (香港創新科技署), Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (广东省科学技术厅), and world-leading battery companies, such as CATL (寧德時代) and XFH (翔豐華), etc.

Before joining PolyU, he was a postdoctoral fellow at National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan, from 2016 to 2020. He received his Ph.D and Bachelor’s degrees, both from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2016 and 2011, respectively, advised by Professor Feiyu Kang. Xiaoliang has published more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers, many of which were published on prestigious journals like Adv. Mater., Adv. Energy Mater. Adv. Funct. Mater., etc. His research work has been cited widely, leading to more than 3000 Google scholar citations with an H-index of 26 (as of May. 2024). One paper was listed as the ESI Highly Cited Paper. Xiaoliang is a reviewer for many prestigious journals, such as Nat. Commun., Adv. Mater., Adv. Energy Mater., etc. He serves as Lead Guest Editor of <em><i>Frontiers in Chemistry</i></em> (JCR Q2, IF=5.2). His research focuses on smart and sustainable battery manufacturing, from electrolyte formulation, electrode preparation to cell fabrication, health monitoring and recycling.
